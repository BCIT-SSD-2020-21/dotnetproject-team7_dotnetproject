## Requirements for documentation (taken from Phil's repo)

### App Description

Korflix is the go-to resource for K drama fans. Users -- predominantly people who like Korean dramas but are looking for more resources / suggestions -- can sign up, post ratings and find shows from an ever-growing list. Basic functionality will support ratings, with written reviews being a stretch goal.

### Installation Instructions
